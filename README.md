# Purpose & personal reasons for doing this project
Given the data set, the purpose of this project is to imagine that I am going to start a restaurant.
Looking at the data I want to find out what is a cost and ingredient effective and efficient way
to create a menu. Seeing as how ingredients are one of the main expenses, bringing cost down is important to
increase the financial efficiency of a business.

### Indian food and me
I love Indian food, and when it is made the right way it is to die for. 
I have always loved curry, and because of that at the start of the pandemic I decided to learn how to cook, indian food.
Not entirely Indian food, I usually stick to any foods between India and Morocco as they tend to use similar ingredients.
And it is a lot easier to cook foods from similar cuisines, in terms of ingredients, than to cook an Italian dish one day, a japanese one, 
and then an Indian dish the other, you could spend a lot of money on only a few meals.

### Why do this project
This project is merely an exercise to improve upon my skills as a data analyst. But I love Indian food, and I do think that if I really
wanted to I could open up my own Indian restaurant, my vision is to have something small, with a small menu, where we take pride in
making everything perfect. Smaller menu = less stress = more success = more perfection, at least that is my thinking. So taking on this project
is almost like an exercise of the imagination, of imagining what could be with a potential restaurant, and one thing I do know is that common, inexpensive
or shared ingredients between dishes in a menu reduces expenses, and should in theory increase profit, as well as give the restraunteer the ability to 
lower their prices more so that they would be more accessible to all.

# Data analysis
The first step in data analysis for this data set is to look at the data, and figure out what about the data will not work for the purposes of this project.
