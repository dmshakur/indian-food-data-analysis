## Purpose
Given the data set, the purpose of this project is to imagine that I am going to start a restaurant.
Looking at the data I want to find out what is a cost and ingredient effective and efficient way
to create a menu. Seeing as how ingredients are one of the main expenses, bringing cost down is important to
increase the financial efficiency of a business.
